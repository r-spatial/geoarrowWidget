# geoarrowWidget: Attach '(Geo)Arrow' and/or '(Geo)Parquet' Data to a Widget

Provides functions and necessary 'JavaScript' bindings to quickly
transfer spatial data from R memory or remote URLs to the browser for
use in interactive 'HTML' widgets created with the 'htmlwidgets' R
package. Leverages 'GeoArrow' (<https://geoarrow.org/>) data
representation for data stored in local R memory which is generally
faster than traditional 'GeoJSON' by minimising the amount of copy and
(de)serialisation steps necessary for the data transfer. Furthermore,
provides functionality and 'JavaScript' bindings to consume 'GeoParquet'
(<https://geoparquet.org/>) files from remote URLs in the browser.
